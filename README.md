I am currently a Computer Science student at Chaffey College and I also study programming on my own in my free time. I really enjoy the process of problem-solving, and ever since I was a kid I competed in Art of Problem Solving competitions continually learning and progressing my knowledge of problem solving. I then applied that to computer science and enjoy the creativity I can put into my own personal projects! I can't wait to see how much I can grow as a Software Engineer!
